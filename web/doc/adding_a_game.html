<h1>Adding the game in the server</h1>

<p>
	Use an existing one as template.
<p>
	In this example, creating a new game called DrekkarGame using existing Yukigassen.
<p>
	Replace DrekkarGame below with the name of your game.
<p>
	This instruction was up to date when it was written but do as Yukigassen or Flame game does it something has been changed after this was written.
<p>
	When it is said below that a class shall extend some super class that can be direct or indirect (that is it can extend another class that in turn extends the required super class).
	
<p>
	<h2>New classes</h2>

	Start by create four classes: DrekkarGameServer, DrekkarGameEntity, DrekkarGameWorld and DrekkarGameAvatar. <p>
	These shall extend respective class, see Yukigassen, the extensions can be indirect.

<p>
<p>
	<H3>DrekkarGameServer</H3>

	Server is a class that contains the code handling the connection with a client program. 
	It shall extend OpServer, the extension can be indirect. 
	For example Server can extend existing class YukigassenServer which in turn extends OpServer.
	That way some existing code in Yukigassen can be used in the new game.
	
	

<p>	
	<h3>DrekkarGameEntity</H3>
	
	This is intended as a common base class for all objects (such as the Avatar class) within the game.

	Entity is the base class for all objects within this game (except the World object).

<p>
	If it is a 3D game: DrekkarGameEntity shall extend D3InterferenceObject.<br>
	If is is a 2D game: DrekkarGameEntity shall extend LuaBase.<br>
<p>
	<h3>DrekkarGameWorld</H3>

	This is the top object for all objects within the game. All other objects in the game will be child objects under this object.
	World extends WorldWithPlayers (directly or indirectly).
<p>

	The world object will need to have some methods.

	<h4>serverForThisWorld</h4>

	In the "world" class remember to set the server name in serverForThisWorld method.
	The name used needs to match that in serverFactory (in PlayerConnectionThread).


	<h4>generateWorld</h4>
	
	This method will be called when a new world is to be generated.
	
	Or should this be replaced by generateSelf

	<h4>linkSelf</h4>

	Overriding this is optional.
<p>
	After linking it is possible to register for various services from the game engine/system. Here we tell the tick rate we need.
	

	<h4>playerJoinedFindOrCreateAvatar</h4>

	This will be called by the super class when a player joins.

	It must find an existing avatar for the player or create a new one.

	Typically the avatar object shall be of type Avatar

<p>
	<h3>DrekkarGameAvatar</H3>

	For each player that connects to the game an avatar object shall be created.
	Avatar shall (directly or indirecly) extend Entity and it shall implement AvatarInterface.

	Avatar is base class for the object created to keep data related to one player. One avatar for each player will be created. Avatar can be visible to other players (as in first person games) or not visible (as in strategy games).


<p>





<h2>Changes in existing code</h2>

<h3>PlayerConnectionThread</h3>


	Add "import se.eit.DrekkarGame_pkg.*;"


	In method serverFactory add:
<pre>

		case 'D':
		case 'd':
		{
			if ((t.equalsIgnoreCase("drekkar")) || (t.equalsIgnoreCase("DrekkarServer")))
			{
				return new DrekkarGameServer();
			}
			break;
		}

</pre>

	Add the games name in the string gamesSupportedByServer. In this case we added drekkar.

<h3>RsbFactory</h3>

	All objects that needs to be saved/loaded from file must be added in the object factory. So Server is not needed here, it is not saved to file (it should be in serverFactory already).
	Look at an existing game such as Yukigassen and do something like that for the new classes (see above).

<pre>
	case 'D':
	{
		final char ch2=t.charAt(1); 
		
		switch(ch2)
		{
			case 'r':
			{
				final char ch3=t.charAt(11);
				switch(ch3)
				{
					case 'A':
						if (t.equalsIgnoreCase("DrekkarGameAvatar"))
						{
							return new DrekkarGameAvatar();
						}
						break;
					
					case 'E':
						if (t.equalsIgnoreCase("DrekkarGameEntity"))
						{
							return new DrekkarGameEntity();
						}
						break;
						// Server is instead added in serverFactory in class PlayerConnectionThread
					/*case 'S':
						if (t.equalsIgnoreCase("DrekkarGameServer"))
						{
							return new DrekkarGameServer();
						}
						break;*/
					case 'W':
						if (t.equalsIgnoreCase("DrekkarGameWorld"))
						{
							return new DrekkarGameWorld();
						}
						break;
					default:
					{
						break;
					}
				}					
				break;
			}
			default:
			{
				break;
			}
		}
</pre>


<p>



<h2>readSelf writeSelf etc</h2>

All objects that extend D3InterferenceObj and WorldWithPlayers etc may need to implement the following methods.

<h3>readSelf and writeSelf</h3>

All object that contain data that must be saved to disk or sent to client must implement these two methods.

They are used for serializing objects. They must call the same method in the super class.

Look at existing code for examples.

<p>
<h3>listInfo, setInfo & getInfo</h3>

These are optional but it helps to have them when debugging.





<h1>Adding the game in a client</h1>

<pre>
	Typically a new client is needed. Use an existing one as example.

	Remember to implement an auto answer to the game_support question, see <a href="protocol.html">protocol.html</a>.

		For example in empire that code looks like this:

			else if (tag=="game_support")
			{
				doSend('"empire"'); // List here all games that this client can handle (it can be more than one separated by space, inside the quotes)
			}

		Send a quited string with the same name as added in servers method serverFactory

</pre>
