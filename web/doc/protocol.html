<h2>Messages from server to client</h2>


<h3>querryPrompt (qp)</h3>

This command (qp for question or querry prompt) is used when server want something from client.
<p>

A qp will look like this:
<pre>
	qp &lt;sub-command&gt; &lt;queryTag&gt; &lt;defaultTextMessage&gt; [&lt;more&gt;]

	Where:
		&lt;sub-command&gt;		: Alias Expected Reply Types, this is what type of reply the server is expecting.
		&lt;queryTag&gt;		: This tells the client which query it is. this is intended to be a unique identifier for every possible question the server has.
		&lt;defaultTextMessage&gt;	: This is a default text in english. It shall be a quoted string. 
					  This is a fallback. If the client has not yet implemented the &lt;queryTag&gt; 
					  it can use this to make a question to the user.
		&lt;more&gt;			: What comes here depends on expectedReplyType, see chapters below.
</pre>

See following sub chapters for possible sub commands alias Expected Reply Types.


<h4>buttonPrompt</h4>

A Subcommand to querryPrompt.
<p>
A number of alternatives will follow after the defaultTextMessage field in the qp message.
<p>
The server will expect one of those as the reply. The client can answer with a number or the entire string of that alternative. If it uses the string it shall be quoted.
<p>
Example:

<pre>
	qp buttonPrompt login_or_reg "Welcome to drekkar" 4 "Login" "Reg new account" "Recover pw" "Cancel"

	Where:
		qp : Server want someting from client
		buttonPrompt : Server will provide answering alternatives. Only one of these are expected as answer.
		login_or_reg : This is the queryTag, in this case server tells client program that it shall bring up the login screen.
		"Welcome to drekkar" : This is the default text for this qp. If client has not implemented the login screen yet it will use a generic dialog and present this text to the user.
		4 : Four answer alternatives will follow
		"Login" : Alternative 0 
		"Reg new account" : Alternative 1
		"Recover pw" : Alternative 2
		"Cancel" : Alternative 3
</pre>


If user chooses "Login" the reply in this example can be:<br>
<pre>
	0
</pre>





<h4>keyPrompt</h4>
A Subcommand to querryPrompt.
<p>

The server wants a keyboard key as reply to this qp.
<p>
The client is expected to answer with either:
<pre>
	* a number representing the key  
	* cancel
</pre>

Example:
<pre>
	qp keyPrompt selectAButton ""enter key to use for jump" 
</pre>

If user chooses "space" the reply in this example can be:
32



<h4>promptString</h4>
A Subcommand to querryPrompt.
<p>

The server want client to prompt user for a text to be entered.
Used to ask client/user a question.

The client is expected to answer with either:
<pre>
	 * some quoted text  
	 * or cancel (unquoted)
</pre>





Example:
<pre>
	qp promptString enter_new_world_name "enter new world name"
</pre>

If user chooses "Antarctica" the reply in this example can be:<br>
"Antarctica"
<p>
Note that the string shall be quoted since it might contain spaces.
<p>
If the user pressed cancel the reply shall be:<br>
cancel
<p>
Note no quotes around cancel.






<h3>openGame</h3>


Syntax:
<pre>
	openGame &lt;type-of-game&gt; &lt;game-name&gt;

	where 
	&lt;type-of-game&gt; : The name of the type of game to open. See also chapter <a href="#check-client-game-support">Check client game support</a>.
	&lt;game-name&gt; : The name of the game that player has joined. The player has perhaps entered the name as part of "Ask user what to do".
</pre>





<h3>avatarId</h3>

This is a command sent from server to client to tell it which object that belongs to the user that the client is handling/serving.

Syntax:
<pre>
	avatarId &lt;id&gt;

	where &lt;id&gt; is a number that identifies the avatar of the player.
</pre>



<h3>mirrorAdd (ma)</h3>

When the server finds an object it wants the client to have it sends a mirrorAdd command.
<p>
The syntax for this is: 
<pre>

	ma &lt;id&gt; &lt;parent id&gt; &lt;type name of object&gt; &lt;object data&gt;

	where:
	&lt;id&gt; is a numeric ID for the object to be added.
	&lt;parent id&gt; is a numeric ID for the parent of the object to be added. 
	&lt;type name of object&gt; There are many different types of objects.
	&lt;object data&gt; what follows here depends on &lt;type name of object&gt;

</pre>

Client is expected to be able to do this, no reply is expected from client.
<p>

If there has been a change in an object that the client should already have it sends mirrorUpdate.


<h3>mirrorUpdate (mu)</h3>

When the server finds an object that has been changed it sends a mirrorUpdate command.
<p>
The syntax for this is same as mirrorAdd message.

<pre>
	ma &lt;id&gt; &lt;parent id&gt; &lt;type name of object&gt; &lt;object data&gt;

<p>
Client shall reply to this with a <a href="cmirrorack">mirrorAck</a> message.
<p>
Syntax:
<pre>
 	mirrorUpdated &lt;some-number&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Don't mix mirrorUpdated with mirrorUpdate (mu), they are similar names but different messages.







<h3>reconnectServer</h3>

When receiving this command client shall close current connection and open a new.


<h3>showWorld</h3>

Client can ignore this.
Probably something old.



<h3>RefCommandReply (rcr)</h3>

Server send this as reply to ReferenceClientCommand
<p>

<pre>
 	rsb_web_game
</pre>




<h3>mirrorAck</h3>

When server has sent mirrorUpdated message the client shall answer with a mirrorAck message.
Client shall send this for handshaking. It tells server how much data client has received. Server must not send to much data at a time.
<p>
Syntax:
<pre>
 	mirrorAck &lt;same-number-as-server-sent&gt;
</pre>


<h3>consoleInput</h3>

This is a simpler version of ReferenceClientCommand
<p>
Syntax:
<pre>
 	consoleInput "&lt;sub command&gt;"
	where:
	&lt;sub command&gt; : Sub commands can be addObj, modObjInfo or delObj. See <a href="#referenceclientcommand-rcc">ReferenceClientCommand (rcc)</a>.
</pre>


<h3>ReferenceClientCommand (rcc)</h3>

ReferenceClientCommand is different from consoleInput in that a reference is supplied that the server will use in the reply message.
<p>

Syntax:
<pre>
 	rcc &lt;ref&gt; &lt;sub command&gt;

	&lt;sub command&gt; : Sub commands can be addObj, modObjInfo or delObj.
</pre>

See following sub chapters for possible sub commands.

<h4>addObj (aoj)</h4>
<p>
Client can send this command when it wants an object to be created by server. It should be sent embedded in an ReferenceClientCommand command.
<p>
Syntax:

<pre>
 	aoj &lt;parentObjId&gt; &lt;objectTypeStr&gt; &lt;more&gt;
	where:
	&lt;parentObjId&gt; : Id of the object to delete.
	&lt;objectTypeStr&gt; : Type name of the object to create
	&lt;more&gt; : What is here depends on the tyme of the object to create.
</pre>

Server will reply ok or nok. 
<p>
Syntax:

<pre>
	ok &lt;objId&gt;
</pre>
<p>
or:
<pre>
	nok "&lt;error message&gt;"
</pre>



<h4>modObjInfo (moi)</h4>

<p>
Syntax:

<pre>
 	moi &lt;objId&gt; &lt;infoTypeStr&gt; &lt;more&gt;
	where:
	&lt;objId&gt; : Id of the object to modify.
	&lt;infoTypeStr&gt; : Which property of the object to modify. 
	&lt;more&gt; : What is here depends on the type of the information to create.
</pre>

	&lt;objId&gt; : Id of the object to delete.
</pre>

Server will reply ok or nok.



<h3>avatarPos</h3>

Syntax:
<pre>
 	avatarPos &lt;pos&gt; &lt;client-squence-number&gt;
	where:
	&lt;pos&gt;			 : This part is different depending on game.
	&lt;client-sequence-number&gt; : This is used for handshaking.
	
</pre>



<h3>actionKey</h3>

This tells server that player pressed the main mouse button (usually the left button, mouse button number 1).
<p>
Syntax:
<pre>
 	actionKey
	
</pre>



<h2>Connection procedure</h2>

<p>
Command lines are to be ended with linefeed (LF) if nothing else is said. For the full syntax of each command/message see respective chapter about it.
<p>
The client program don't need to have implemented handling for all these questions. It can use a generic code for all qp/buttonPrompt/stringPrompt etc using the default text sent from server to let user know what server wants to know.
<p>

<h3>Connect</h3>

Client connects to the server port. Typically TCP port 8080.

<h3>Normal or web</h3>

Client must first tell server if it is a normal (aka native) client or a websocket client.


normal: Skip websocket below (if client is not websocket).
<p>
websocket:

Client sends a GET, HEAD or other html command to tell server it is a web browser.
When html has been upgraded to websocket connection the session continues same as for a normal client save for the websocket overhead.
 
<h3>Start talking</h3>


<p>
Client shall now tell server that it wants to talk.
<p>
To do so it sends command: 
<pre>
rsb_web_game
</pre>

<h3>Verifying protocol and version</h3>
<p>
Next server will tell client that it is a server that understands the RSB server client protocol version 0.9.

<p>
To do this server sends: 
<pre>
	www.eit.se/rsb/0.9/server
</pre>

<p>
Client shall now tell server that it is a client that understands the RSB server client protocol
<p>
To do this client sends:
<pre>
	www.eit.se/rsb/0.9/client
</pre>


<p>

After both having verified that they can communicate with each other the server will now drive the session. 
Server does so by sending queries to client.

<p>

<h3>Check client game support</h3>

<p>
Next server will ask the client which games it can do.


<p>
To do so it will send a qp command. 
More exactly a qp command with expected reply as string and tag "game_support".
<p>
For details see the qp command. In this case it will look like this:
<pre>
	qp stringPrompt game_support "Which games does this client support?"
</pre>
<p>
For details on the qp message see that chapter.
<p>
The client shall answer, answer can be:
<pre>
	"Yukigassen"
</pre>
Note that the reply shall be a quoted string. More than one game name can be given within the quotes if the client program can do more than one game.
<p>

<h3>Player Login Or Recover Pw</h3>
<p>
After checking game support the login screen is to be shown to user/player.
<p>
Server sends command
<pre>
	qp buttonPrompt login_or_reg "Welcome to drekkar" 4 "Login" "Reg new account" "Recover pw" "Cancel"
</pre>
<p>
A typical reply from client can be:
<pre>
	0
</pre>

Which means user want to login.

In this example we assume the player has already registered so he or she wants to login.


<h3>Player Login</h3>
<p>
When user want to login the server will ask for username.


Server sends command:
<pre>
	qp promptString "enter_player_name" "enter your name"
</pre>


A typical reply from client can be:
<pre>
	"aaa"
</pre>
Note that the username shall be inside quotes as always on a promptString.

<p>
After that server asks for password:
<pre>
	qp promptString "enter_player_pw" "give password"
</pre>

A typical reply from client can be:
<pre>
	"qwerty"
</pre>


If the password was correct server will send:
<pre>
	qp buttonPrompt "login_ok" "login ok" 1 "OK"
</pre>

This is just to tell client it was OK. But client must answer:
<pre>
	"OK"
</pre>
	
Client could also have answered 0 since that was the alternative for "OK".


<p>
<h3>Player Preferences</h3>
<p>
After a successfull login the server will send players key mappings etc.
These are stored on server and not on client side.

For example the server can send:
<pre>
	playerPreference jumpUp "32"
	playerPreference moveForward "65"
</pre>


The client does not need to answer these commands, just remember the settings if they are even needed.
<p>
TODO We shall let the client ask for these later...


<p>

<h3>Ask user what to do</h3>
<p>
After login and player preferences the server will ask client what the user wants to do.
<p>

This is done with a qp message with the tag "join_or_create". In this case it would look like this:
<pre>
	qp promptButtons join_or_create "Do you want to join an existing game or start a new?" 5 "Continue game" "Start new game" "List existing games" "Account settings" "Cancel"
</pre>

<p>
If for example the user wants to start a new game the then the client shall send:
<pre>
	1	
</pre>

That is for alternative 1 which is "Start new game" in the qp/promptButtons/join_or_create message.

<p>
What follows may vary.
The server can continue with some more questions like this until it is time to startup the game.
<pre>
    	qp buttonPrompt "joining_world" "joining world..." 1 "OK"
</pre>

<p>

<h3>Open game</h3>

When server launches the game it will send an "openGame" command. 
<p>
After that the server will send mirror messages and it is instead the client that sends commands.

<p>



<h3>Mirroring</h3>

Once a game is open the server will send mirroring messages to client while client can send commads to server.
