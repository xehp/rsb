Receivers will need to store this in linked queues, it is a costly operation to add to linked queues, it is done for all connected clients and its done with database write locked. A better way is to use a simple round buffer within the database. Only one round buffer is needed, clients only need a counter each so they know how far they have read in the round buffer. Clients can have their get changes from it while database is only read locked.
